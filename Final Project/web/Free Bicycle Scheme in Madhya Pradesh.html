Free cycle distribution scheme has been launched by the Madhya Pradesh government to motivate students to continue education after primary level. The main objective is to provide bicycles to girls and boys to make it easier for them to commute to another village to attend school. It has come as a boon for those students who could not continue studies just because of the distance of the educational institute from their home. Before the implementation of this scheme, there were lakhs of girls, who had left studies after completing primary education only because there was no middle, high or higher secondary school in their village and they did not have means to travel to other villages to pursue education. Going on foot was difficult as well as risky. The scheme has removed all these hurdles. Under the scheme, the free bicycle is given by the state government to a rural students both girl and boys, who takes admission in class IX in another village. The schemeâ€™s benefit is given to village girls belonging to scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, backward class as well as general category.<br><br>

1.	The female and the male students are provided bicycles of their choice and their Guardian is given a crossed cheque of Rs 2,400/-<br>
2.	If the cost of the cycle is above Rs 2400/- the extra cost of the cycle is to be paid by the guardian of the student (boy/girl)<br>
3.	The responsibility of allocating the cycle to the beneficiary boy and girl child is the responsibility of the head of the organization, however, the purchasing, quality, and selection of the cycle are the responsibility of the boy and the girl beneficiary as well as of the guardian.<br>
<br>Eligibility for Getting Benefits of Free Bicycle Scheme:<br>
1.	Girls and boys studying in standard 9th belonging to the rural sector who belong to villages where government high school has not been set up and they have to travel from one village to the other/ town/city to receive education are eligible<br>
2.	The money to buy the cycle is granted to the boy and the girl child in an organized ceremony/event. Elected representatives from the Panchayati Raj Institutions are also required to be invited to this event<br>
