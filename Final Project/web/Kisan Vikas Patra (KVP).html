 <h2><b><i>Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP)</i></b></h2>

 <div id="mainbody">
		<font size="4"><br>
 Kisan Vikas Patra is a small savings instrument that will facilitate people to invest in a long term savings plan. This scheme was originally introduced by the Government of India in 1988 and was again reintroduced in 2014 with some changes. Even though this scheme was popular, a Government Committee formed in 2011 suggested that KVP could be misused for purposes like money laundering. In 2014, Kisan Vikas Patra was relaunched with a number of changes including mandatory PAN Card proof for investments over Rs.50,000 and income source proof for investments exceeding Rs.10 lakh. The main advantage of opening a KVP investment is the availability and ease of process – the Small Savings Directorate offers KVP certificates in all Post Offices across the country. Any resident Indian can invest in a KVP scheme and can obtain a certificate either jointly, individually or in the name of a minor. The principal amount invested in KVP will be doubled in a time of 8 years and 4 months or 100 months. The main target audience for this scheme is people in semi-urban and rural areas where people easily fall prey to Ponzi schemes.
<br><br>
Kisan Vikas Patra Benefits:<br>
<br>
A KVP certificate is offered in multiple denominations that gives flexibility to the customers. The denominations vary from Rs.100 to a maximum of Rs.50,000<br>
It is a scheme offered by the Government of India and hence the investor can be sure of returns on invested amount. Under KVP, the holder will get double the principal in a short period of eight years and four months<br>
People who are looking for risk free investment option will benefit from KVP scheme. Also, it is unaffected by inflation as the interest rate remains the same<br>
There is no cap on the amount that one can invest in KVP. Depending on the purchase power, a person can buy any amount<br>
Kisan Vikas Patra certificate can be presented as collateral against loans. Investors can use the same to obtain a loan from banks<br>
Applicants also have the option to withdraw the amount prematurely in KVP. The lock in period is two years and six months<br>
Kisan Vikas Patra is transferable from one person to the other. To pass on the benefits to the new holder, the owner must fulfil all required formalities. Before transferring it to a new holder, it is important to receive an approval at the post office<br>
A KVP holder can enjoy tax benefits. The income from KVP is taxable but there is no tax deduction on entire money received at maturity, there is no tax deduction at source<br>
Kisan Vikas Patra Eligibility:<br>
<br>
The applicant must be an adult and a resident Indian.<br>
The applicant can apply for Kisan Vikas Patra on his own name or on behalf of a minor.<br>
Trusts are eligible to invest in Kisan Vikas Patra. HUFs (Hindu Undivided Family) and NRIs are not eligible to invest in KVP<br>
Pro and Corns of Kisan Vikas Patra:<br>

The current interest rates on bank fixed deposits for 8 year term are around 8.5% (around 9% for senior citizens). People can expect reduction in interest rates by RBI in the coming quarters. Even if RBI reduces interest rates, the expected annual yield on Kisan Vikas Patra which is 8.67% is not a great return on investment<br>
Also, investments in KVP are not eligible for any tax benefits under Section 80c. If people really want to invest in a safe investment avenue then person can book a 5 year Bank Fixed deposits and get tax benefits too<br><br>
KVP does not have tax benefits and Lock-in period is applicable<br><br>
Consider investing in Public Provident Fund (15 years lock-in will be there) if safety is priority<br>
Person can consider investing in National Savings Certificate (NSC – 5 years) which is available at 8.5% interest rate. Also, it has tax benefits too (under section 80c)<br>
